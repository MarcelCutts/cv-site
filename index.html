				<p class="project-label">ZOMBIES, RUN! Platform <br />
					<em>Python, Django, Flask, Javascript, Angular, AWS</em>
				</p>
				<p><more>Millions of runners world-wide play 'Zombies, Run!', a fitness game in which players run in the real world to progress through a story.  
				<br />
				We decided to turn this already successful paid iOS and Android item into a free product, greatly increasing the number of players and taxing the current infrastructure far past its capacity.  
				<br />
				This presented us a number of challenges - how do we capture and sync heavy run data across devices? How do we transfer large content files to clients as they need them? How do we internally manage and test content and features? How do we migrate our large and unwieldy data store to this new platform?
				<br />
				While lessons had been learnt from the previous system, it was fundementally unscalable and missing key features we'd wanted to launch with - leading me to the decision of creating a new platform. This was tackled through creating a number of cleanly decoupled microservices that talked through an established API, allowing us to scale easily through simply adding more hardware as required.

				<p class="project-label">DATA SANDBOX VISUALISATION <br />
					<em>JavaScript, Python, D3, HTML5/CSS3, Bottle, Jasmine, SqlLite, UX</em>
				</p>
				<p><more>A national birth study of approximately 100,000 people over a number of years is currently occurring in the UK, driven by an academic institution. The scale of such a project was novel for the institute, and as a combination of consultant and developer I was brought in to see what I could offer to help.
				<br />
				Once the domain and stakeholders were known, I decided that the most beneficial item for the study at that moment would be a model allowing them to quickly test possible study decisions. The impact of any decision on the study over time could then be reviewed and evaluated. 
				<br />
				The intent was to provide the institute the power to not only quickly, but confidently make decisions in a time constrained environment. This was achieved through an application with a well designed, UX driven, front-end written in JavaScript. Users could  alter an extensive set of parameters by interacting with a number of intuitive D3 visualisations and other mechanisms. In tandem, a Python back-end handled all modelling calculations and server aspects. All computations and visualisations were driven in real-time, allowing the users to quickly play in a study "sandbox", tweaking the parameters, and instantly seeing the predicted study metrics and results over the next number of years. 
				<br />
				In addition to new decision driving capabilities,  thanks to diligent design efforts, the application found a secondary purpose as presentation tool for displaying figures and scenarios.<br/><br/>

				<p class="project-label">PHARMACEUTICAL PORTAL <br />
					<em>C#, MSSQL, Entity Framework, MVC4, nUnit, nSubstitute, WF, WCF, Unity, UX
					</em>
					</p>
				<p><more>The portal offers a number of services providing speciality pharmaceuticals, including a Global Access Program which is intended to provide unlicensed or trial-phase drugs to patients in need, internationally and domestically.
				<br />
				A solution was required to handle requesting, validation, procurement, shipping and tracking of these drugs by health care professionals, via pharmaceutical suppliers, while fulfilling all necessary industry regulations. As the software gained clients, analytics and reporting were developed to aid in overseeing the complex pharmaceutical chain. 
				<br />
				A web-based application was created, by myself in a small scrum team, to satisfy these requirements. We used an MVVM architecture built on .Net’s MVC4 framework as the foundation and applied principles of agile, with rigorous unit testing and continuous integration testing throughout.
				<br />
				The result is a highly accessible portal for users and clients, which automated several previously manual processes. This allowed the client to rapidly expand its program range with minimal additional effort.<br/><br/>

				<p class="project-label">ACCELERATOR SENSORS<br />
					<em>C++, Qt, CMake

				</p>
				<p><more>Particle accelerators hold an array of sensors to detect various energies and particles present, numbering in the thousands. The state of the detectors has significant impact on the interpretation of any possible results, and therefore require management.
				<br />
				I had sole responsibility of creating a system to visualise, review, manage these sensors which involved both an understanding of the physics at hand, as well as the software knowledge to integrate with the broader software suite being developed. All data processing was achieved through custom C++ libraries, and Qt was chosen to create the visualisations and user interface.

				The project was completed and presented to an international audience. It is now primed to be used when the accelerator goes live in the future.

				<p><more>During my time with this department, a significant shift was going through the security printing industry which focused less on chemistry in inks and watermarks and looked more towards advanced optical effects as deterrents to counterfeiting.
				<br />
				Due to the traditional nature of the company, no programming and few quantitative data systems or processes existed. I proposed and spear-headed an image analysis suite that could output several metrics on the goodness of produced products, as well as checking for the viability of various new technologies. Technologically, this was achieved through a combination of python programming and hardware hacking with available supplies.
				<br />
				This created a brand new automated quality assurance process, which allowed products relying on tighter tolerances to be manufactured, and gave the research division previously unavailable insights.<br/><br/>

				<br />
				The work involved alterations at the database level, writing packages to handle data directly into large currently existing Oracle systems  and front end user design. Alongside the application, a background web service was developed with WCF to allow other departments within JANET to use the functionality of the application without having to write it themselves. All tasks were completed using continuous integration featuring both unit and front end testing.
				<br />
				The application has proven popular, handling all certificate and domain name issues for the organisation, increasing their product range and allowing the organisation to free up a large number of resources for other critical projects.
